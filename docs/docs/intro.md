# Dokimos Overview

Dokimos is an open-source Evaluation framework for LLM applications in Java that helps you:

1. Build load datasets programatically, file-based, or with custom sources
2. Run experiments with built-in evaluators, or your own custom evaluators
3. Run evals in a test-driven way with parameterized tests

... to provide the essential foundation for building LLM applications (in Java).

Read the **[Getting started Guide](https://dokimos-dev.github.io/getting-started)**.

Lean more about what you can build with `dokimos` by exploring the [examples module](https://github.com/dokimos-dev/dokimos/tree/master/dokimos-examples).
